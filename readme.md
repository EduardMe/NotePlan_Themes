# NotePlan 3 Themes

Here's a small collection of themes (some cloned from other apps we love) for [NotePlan 3](https://noteplan.co). Please note, this currently requires NotePlan 3 Beta v615 or later. 

## Installing new scripts

To install a new theme, simply download the .json file, open NotePlan 3 Preferences > Themes, and choose `Import Theme...`. Custom themes are listed below the default built in themes.
